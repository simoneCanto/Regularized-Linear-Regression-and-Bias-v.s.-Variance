# Regularized-Linear-Regression-and-Bias-v.s.-Variance

In this exercise, you will implement regularized linear regression and use it to study models with different bias-variance properties. Before starting on the programming exercise, we strongly recommend watching the video lectures and completing the review questions for the associated topics.

To get started with the exercise, you will need to download the starter code and unzip its contents to the directory where you wish to complete the exercise. If needed, use the cd command in Octave/MATLAB to change to this directory before starting this exercise.

You can also find instructions for installing Octave/MATLAB in the \Environment Setup Instructions" of the course website. Files included in this exercise ex5.m - Octave/MATLAB script that steps you through the exercise ex5data1.mat - Dataset submit.m - Submission script that sends your solutions to our servers featureNormalize.m - Feature normalization function
fmincg.m - Function minimization routine (similar to fminunc) plotFit.m - Plot a polynomial fit trainLinearReg.m - Trains linear regression using your cost function

1.linearRegCostFunction.m - Regularized linear regression cost function
2.learningCurve.m - Generates a learning curve
3.polyFeatures.m - Maps data into polynomial feature space
4.validationCurve.m - Generates a cross validation curve
5.indicates files you will need to complete

Throughout the exercise, you will be using the script ex5.m. These scripts set up the dataset for the problems and make calls to functions that you will write. You are only required to modify functions in other files, by following the instructions in this assignment.
